Sandwiches cost \(\$4.50\) each and soft drinks cost \(\$1.00\) each. Ike and Mike plan to buy as many sandwiches as they can, and use any remaining money to buy soft drinks. Counting both sandwiches and soft drinks, how many items will they buy?

The hare eagerly agrees and quickly runs ahead, leaving the slow-moving tortoise behind. Confident that he will win, the hare stops to take a nap.
