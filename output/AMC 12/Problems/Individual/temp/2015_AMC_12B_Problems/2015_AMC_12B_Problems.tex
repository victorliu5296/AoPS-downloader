Her GPA on the four classes she is taking is computed as the total sum of points divided by 4. She is certain that she will get As in both Mathematics and Science, and at least a C in each of English and History. She thinks she has a \(\tfrac{1}{6}\) chance of getting an A in English, and a \(\tfrac{1}{4}\) chance of getting a B.

Define a function \(f: \{0,1,2,3,\dots\} \times \{0,1,2,3,4\} \to \{0,1,2,3,4\}\) recursively as follows:


\begin{equation*}
f(i,j) = \begin{cases}\text{mod}_5 (j+1) & \text{ if } i = 0 \text{ and } 0 \le j \le 4 \text{,}\\

However, instead of walking up the steps one at a time, both Cozy and Dash jump. Cozy goes two steps up with each jump (though if necessary, he will just jump the last step). Dash goes five steps up with each jump (though if necessary, he will just jump the last steps if there are fewer than 5 steps left). Suppose that Dash takes 19 fewer jumps than Cozy to reach the top of the staircase. Let \(s\) denote the sum of all possible numbers of steps this staircase can have.
