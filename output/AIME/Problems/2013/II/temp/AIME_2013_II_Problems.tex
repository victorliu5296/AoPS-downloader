Digital clocks would then be produced that would read $\text{9:99}$ just before midnight, $\text{0:00}$ at midnight, $\text{1:25}$ at the former $\text{3:00}$ AM, and $\text{7:50}$ at the former $\text{6:00}$ PM. After the conversion, a person who wanted to wake up at the equivalent of the former $\text{6:36}$ AM would set his new digital alarm clock for $\text{A:BC}$, where $\text{A}$, $\text{B}$, and $\text{C}$ are digits. Find $100\text{A}+10\text{B}+\text{C}$.\par \vspace{0.5em}\item Positive integers $a$ and $b$ satisfy the condition

\begin{equation*}
\log_2(\log_{2^a}(\log_{2^b}(2^{1000}))) = 0.
\end{equation*}

Find the sum of all possible values of $a+b$.\par \vspace{0.5em}\item A large candle is $119$ centimeters tall.  It is designed to burn down more quickly when it is first lit and more slowly as it approaches its bottom.  Specifically, the candle takes $10$ seconds to burn down the first centimeter from the top, $20$ seconds to burn down the second centimeter, and $10k$ seconds to burn down the $k$-th centimeter.  Suppose it takes $T$ seconds for the candle to burn down completely.  Then $\tfrac{T}{2}$ seconds after it is lit, the candle's height in centimeters will be $h$.  Find $10h$.\par \vspace{0.5em}\item In the Cartesian plane let $A = (1,0)$ and $B = \left( 2, 2\sqrt{3} \right)$.  Equilateral triangle $ABC$ is constructed so that $C$ lies in the first quadrant.  Let $P=(x,y)$ be the center of $\triangle ABC$.  Then $x \cdot y$ can be written as $\tfrac{p\sqrt{q}}{r}$, where $p$ and $r$ are relatively prime positive integers and $q$ is an integer that is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $p+q+r$.\par \vspace{0.5em}\item In equilateral $\triangle ABC$ let points $D$ and $E$ trisect $\overline{BC}$. Then $\sin(\angle DAE)$ can be expressed in the form $\frac{a\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $a$ and $c$ are relatively prime positive integers, and $b$ is an integer that is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a+b+c$.\par \vspace{0.5em}\item Find the least positive integer $N$ such that the set of $1000$ consecutive integers beginning with $1000\cdot N$ contains no square of an integer.\par \vspace{0.5em}\item A group of clerks is assigned the task of sorting $1775$ files. Each clerk sorts at a constant rate of $30$ files per hour. At the end of the first hour, some of the clerks are reassigned to another task; at the end of the second hour, the same number of the remaining clerks are also reassigned to another task, and a similar assignment occurs at the end of the third hour. The group finishes the sorting in $3$ hours and $10$ minutes. Find the number of files sorted during the first one and a half hours of sorting.\par \vspace{0.5em}\item A hexagon that is inscribed in a circle has side lengths $22$, $22$, $20$, $22$, $22$, and $20$ in that order. The radius of the circle can be written as $p+\sqrt{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are positive integers. Find $p+q$.\par \vspace{0.5em}\item A $7\times 1$ board is completely covered by $m\times 1$ tiles without overlap; each tile may cover any number of consecutive squares, and each tile lies completely on the board. Each tile is either red, blue, or green. Let $N$ be the number of tilings of the $7\times 1$ board in which all three colors are used at least once. For example, a $1\times 1$ red tile followed by a $2\times 1$ green tile, a $1\times 1$ green tile, a $2\times 1$ blue tile, and a $1\times 1$ green tile is a valid tiling. Note that if the $2\times 1$ blue tile is replaced by two $1\times 1$ blue tiles, this results in a different tiling. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.\par \vspace{0.5em}\item Given a circle of radius $\sqrt{13}$, let $A$ be a point at a distance $4 + \sqrt{13}$ from the center $O$ of the circle. Let $B$ be the point on the circle nearest to point $A$. A line passing through the point $A$ intersects the circle at points $K$ and $L$. The maximum possible area for $\triangle BKL$ can be written in the form $\frac{a - b\sqrt{c}}{d}$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are positive integers, $a$ and $d$ are relatively prime, and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a+b+c+d$.\par \vspace{0.5em}\item Let $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$, and let $N$ be the number of functions $f$ from set $A$ to set $A$ such that $f(f(x))$ is a constant function. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.\par \vspace{0.5em}\item Let $S$ be the set of all polynomials of the form $z^3 + az^2 + bz + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers. Find the number of polynomials in $S$ such that each of its roots $z$ satisfies either $|z| = 20$ or $|z| = 13$.\par \vspace{0.5em}\item In $\triangle ABC$, $AC = BC$, and point $D$ is on $\overline{BC}$ so that $CD = 3\cdot BD$. Let $E$ be the midpoint of $\overline{AD}$. Given that $CE = \sqrt{7}$ and $BE = 3$, the area of $\triangle ABC$ can be expressed in the form $m\sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n$.\par \vspace{0.5em}\item For positive integers $n$ and $k$, let $f(n, k)$ be the remainder when $n$ is divided by $k$, and for $n > 1$ let $F(n) = \max_{\substack{1\le k\le \frac{n}{2}}} f(n, k)$. Find the remainder when $\sum\limits_{n=20}^{100} F(n)$ is divided by $1000$.\par \vspace{0.5em}\item Let $A,B,C$ be angles of an acute triangle with

\begin{equation*}
\cos^2 A + \cos^2 B + 2 \sin A \sin B \cos C &= \frac{15}{8} \text{ and} \\
\cos^2 B + \cos^2 C + 2 \sin B \sin C \cos A &= \frac{14}{9}
\end{equation*}

There are positive integers $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$ for which 
\begin{equation*}
\cos^2 C + \cos^2 A + 2 \sin C \sin A \cos B = \frac{p-q\sqrt{r}}{s},
\end{equation*}
 where $p+q$ and $s$ are relatively prime and $r$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $p+q+r+s$.
