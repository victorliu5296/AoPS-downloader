\begin{document}\maketitle\thispagestyle{fancy}\newpage\section*{2011 AIME I}\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., itemsep=0.5em]\item Jar \(A\) contains four liters of a solution that is \(45\%\) acid. Jar \(B\) contains five liters of a solution that is \(48\%\) acid. Jar \(C\) contains one liter of a solution that is \(k\%\) acid. From jar \(C\), \(\frac{m}{n}\) liters of the solution is added to jar \(A\), and the remainder of the solution in jar \(C\) is added to jar B. At the end both jar \(A\) and jar \(B\) contain solutions that are \(50\%\) acid. Given that \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers, find \(k + m + n\).\par \vspace{0.5em}\item In rectangle \(ABCD\), \(AB = 12\) and \(BC = 10\).  Points \(E\) and \(F\) lie inside rectangle \(ABCD\) so that \(BE = 9\), \(DF = 8\), \(\overline{BE} \parallel \overline{DF}\), \(\overline{EF} \parallel \overline{AB}\), and line \(BE\) intersects segment \(\overline{AD}\).  The length \(EF\) can be expressed in the form \(m \sqrt{n} - p\), where \(m\), \(n\), and \(p\) are positive integers and \(n\) is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find \(m + n + p\).\par \vspace{0.5em}\item Let \(L\) be the line with slope \(\frac{5}{12}\) that contains the point \(A = (24,-1)\), and let \(M\) be the line perpendicular to line \(L\) that contains the point \(B = (5,6)\).  The original coordinate axes are erased, and line \(L\) is made the \(x\)-axis and line \(M\) the \(y\)-axis.  In the new coordinate system, point \(A\) is on the positive \(x\)-axis, and point \(B\) is on the positive \(y\)-axis.  The point \(P\) with coordinates \((-14,27)\) in the original system has coordinates \((\alpha,\beta)\) in the new coordinate system.  Find \(\alpha + \beta\).\par \vspace{0.5em}\item In triangle \(ABC\), \(AB = 125\), \(AC = 117\), and \(BC = 120\).  The angle bisector of angle \(A\) intersects \(\overline{BC}\) at point \(L\), and the angle bisector of angle \(B\) intersects \(\overline{AC}\) at point \(K\).  Let \(M\) and \(N\) be the feet of the perpendiculars from \(C\) to \(\overline{BK}\) and \(\overline{AL}\), respectively.  Find \(MN\).\par \vspace{0.5em}\item The vertices of a regular nonagon (9-sided polygon) are to be labeled with the digits 1 through 9 in such a way that the sum of the numbers on every three consecutive vertices is a multiple of 3.  Two acceptable arrangements are considered to be indistinguishable if one can be obtained from the other by rotating the nonagon in the plane.  Find the number of distinguishable acceptable arrangements.\par \vspace{0.5em}\item Suppose that a parabola has vertex \(\left(\frac{1}{4},-\frac{9}{8}\right)\) and equation \(y = ax^2 + bx + c\), where \(a > 0\) and \(a + b + c\) is an integer.  The minimum possible value of \(a\) can be written in the form \(\frac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers.  Find \(p + q\).\par \vspace{0.5em}\item Find the number of positive integers \(m\) for which there exist nonnegative integers \(x_0\), \(x_1\) , \(\dots\) , \(x_{2011}\) such that

\begin{equation*}
m^{x_0} = \sum_{k = 1}^{2011} m^{x_k}.
\end{equation*}
\par \vspace{0.5em}\item In triangle \(ABC\), \(BC = 23\), \(CA = 27\), and \(AB = 30\).  Points \(V\) and \(W\) are on \(\overline{AC}\) with \(V\) on \(\overline{AW}\), points \(X\) and \(Y\) are on \(\overline{BC}\) with \(X\) on \(\overline{CY}\), and points \(Z\) and \(U\) are on \(\overline{AB}\) with \(Z\) on \(\overline{BU}\).  In addition, the points are positioned so that \(\overline{UV} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{WX} \parallel \overline{AB}\), and \(\overline{YZ} \parallel \overline{CA}\).  Right angle folds are then made along \(\overline{UV}\), \(\overline{WX}\), and \(\overline{YZ}\).  The resulting figure is placed on a level floor to make a table with triangular legs.  Let \(h\) be the maximum possible height of a table constructed from triangle \(ABC\) whose top is parallel to the floor.  Then \(h\) can be written in the form \(\frac{k \sqrt{m}}{n}\), where \(k\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers and \(m\) is a positive integer that is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find \(k + m + n\).
