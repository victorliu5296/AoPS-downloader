\begin{document}\maketitle\thispagestyle{fancy}\newpage\section*{2021 AIME I}\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., itemsep=0.5em]\item Zou and Chou are practicing their \(100\)-meter sprints by running \(6\) races against each other. Zou wins the first race, and after that, the probability that one of them wins a race is \(\frac23\) if they won the previous race but only \(\frac13\) if they lost the previous race. The probability that Zou will win exactly \(5\) of the \(6\) races is \(\frac mn\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(m+n\).\par \vspace{0.5em}\item In the diagram below, \(ABCD\) is a rectangle with side lengths \(AB=3\) and \(BC=11\), and \(AECF\) is a rectangle with side lengths \(AF=7\) and \(FC=9,\) as shown. The area of the shaded region common to the interiors of both rectangles is \(\frac mn\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(m+n\).

At the end of each minute, simultaneously, each of the three frogs jumps to one of the two vertices adjacent to its current position, chosen randomly and independently with both choices being equally likely.
